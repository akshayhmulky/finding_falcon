# Finding Falcone!

King Shan has received intelligence that Al Falcone is in hiding in one of these 6 planets - DonLon, Enchai, Jebing, Sapir, Lerbin & Pingasor. However he has limited resources at his disposal & can send his army to only 4 of these planets.

## Steps to play:

- Select 4 planets to search (out of the total 6)
- Select which space vehicles to send to these planets
- See how much time it will take for the vehicles to reach their targets
- Final result will show if you are able to find the planet or not

## Points to Remember:

- There are 4 types of vehicles.
- The units of each vehicle type vary (eg:- there are 2 space pods but only 1 space
  rocket).
- All have different ranges (maximum distance it can travel). If the range for a vehicle
  is lesser than the distance to the planet, it cannot be chosen for going to the planet.
- All have different speed. Based on the distance to the planet and the speed of the
  vehicle, time taken for the complete search should be shown.
